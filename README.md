# Get KPIs from microclimatic data in a specific area to show feasibility of X projet: Energy, Cultures, Civilization, GW... 
# Basically --> What kind of activity is possible in the area based on the data set?
# The goal is to get an efficient way to use this kind of data to measure the options of an area 
# For example a Foundation, Billionaire, Government looking to invest in meaningful projects in one specific area

# Primary guess would be that it's overall hard to assess the "weather"/"climate" situation of an area, especially today.
# Data Set that keeps monitoring crucial + case-by-case analysis (Theory of chaos, basically infinite factors influencing each zone)
